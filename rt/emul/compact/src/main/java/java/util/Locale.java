/**
 * A <code>Locale</code> object represents a specific geographical, political,
 * or cultural region. An operation that requires a <code>Locale</code> to perform
 * its task is called <em>locale-sensitive</em> and uses the <code>Locale</code>
 * to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
 * is a locale-sensitive operation&mdash; the number should be formatted
 * according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
 * region, or culture.
 *
 * <p> The <code>Locale</code> class implements identifiers
 * interchangeable with BCP 47 (IETF BCP 47, "Tags for Identifying
 * Languages"), with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode Locale
 * Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
 * exchange.
 *
 * <p> A <code>Locale</code> object logically consists of the fields
 * described below.
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><a name="def_language"/><b>language</b></dt>
 *
 *   <dd>ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
 *   language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
 *   When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
 *   alpha-2 code must be used.  You can find a full list of valid
 *   language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
 *   "Type: language").  The language field is case insensitive, but
 *   <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to lower case.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Well-formed language values have the form
 *   <code>[a-zA-Z]{2,8}</code>.  Note that this is not the the full
 *   BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang.  They are
 *   not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
 *   them.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dt><a name="def_script"/><b>script</b></dt>
 *
 *   <dd>ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code.  You can find a full list of
 *   valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
 *   for "Type: script").  The script field is case insensitive, but
 *   <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to title case (the first
 *   letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
 *   case).</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Well-formed script values have the form
 *   <code>[a-zA-Z]{4}</code></dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dt><a name="def_region"/><b>country (region)</b></dt>
 *
 *   <dd>ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
 *   You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
 *   IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region").  The
 *   country (region) field is case insensitive, but
 *   <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to upper case.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Well-formed country/region values have
 *   the form <code>[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}</code></dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
 *   (Caribbean)</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dt><a name="def_variant"/><b>variant</b></dt>
 *
 *   <dd>Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a
 *   <code>Locale</code>.  Where there are two or more variant values
 *   each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
 *   by importance, with most important first, separated by
 *   underscore('_').  The variant field is case sensitive.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
 *   subtags.  Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
 *   additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
 *   are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
 *   region subtags.  You can find a full list of valid variant codes
 *   in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").
 *
 *   <p>However, the variant field in <code>Locale</code> has
 *   historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
 *   language variations.  For example, some supported variants
 *   available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
 *   cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script.  In
 *   BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
 *   language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
 *   subtags.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Well-formed variant values have the form <code>SUBTAG
 *   (('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*</code> where <code>SUBTAG =
 *   [0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}</code>. (Note: BCP 47 only

 *
 *   <dd>A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
 *   extensions apart from language identification.  The extensions in
 *   <code>Locale</code> implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
 *   extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
 *   case insensitive, but <code>Locale</code> canonicalizes all
 *   extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
 *   cannot have empty values.</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Well-formed keys are single characters from the set
 *   <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]</code>.  Well-formed values have the form

 *   <code>SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}</code> and for other keys
 *   <code>SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}</code> (that is, 'x' allows
 *   single-character subtags).</dd><br>
 *
 *   <dd>Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
 *   key="x"/value="java-1-7"</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
 * in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the <code>Locale</code> class
 * does not provide any validation features.  The <code>Builder</code>
 * only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
 * requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
 * itself.  See {@link Builder} for details.
 *
 * <h4><a name="def_locale_extension">Unicode locale/language extension</h4>
 *
 * <p>UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
 * attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
 * associated with a locale.  A keyword is represented by a pair of
 * key and type.  For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
 * digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
 * (key:"nu").
 *
 * <p>The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
 * extension key 'u' ({@link #UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION}).  The above
 * example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".code
 *
 * <p>Thus, when a <code>Locale</code> object contains Unicode locale
 * attributes and keywords,
 * <code>getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)</code> will return a
 * String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai".  The
 * <code>Locale</code> class also provides {@link
 * #getUnicodeLocaleAttributes}, {@link #getUnicodeLocaleKeys}, and
 * {@link #getUnicodeLocaleType} which allow you to access Unicode
 * locale attributes and key/type pairs directly.  When represented as
 * a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
 * alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
 * alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
 * fixed when the type is defined)
 *
 * <p>A well-formed locale key has the form
 * <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}</code>.  A well-formed locale type has the
 * form <code>"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*</code> (it
 * can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length).  A
 * well-formed locale attribute has the form
 * <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}</code> (it is a single subtag with the same
 * form as a locale type subtag).
 *
 * <p>The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
 * locale-sensitive services.  Although the LDML specification defines
 * various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
 * implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
 * particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.
 *
 * <h4>Creating a Locale</h4>
 *
 * <p>There are several different ways to create a <code>Locale</code>
 * object.
 *
 * <h5>Builder</h5>
 *
 * <p>Using {@link Builder} you can construct a <code>Locale</code> object
 * that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.
 *
 * <h5>Constructors</h5>
 *
 * <p>The <code>Locale</code> class provides three constructors:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     {@link #Locale(String language)}
 *     {@link #Locale(String language, String country)}
 *     {@link #Locale(String language, String country, String variant)}
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * These constructors allow you to create a <code>Locale</code> object
 * with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
 * script or extensions.
 *
 * <h5>Factory Methods</h5>
 *
 * <p>The method {@link #forLanguageTag} creates a <code>Locale</code>
 * object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.
 *
 * <h5>Locale Constants</h5>
 *
 * <p>The <code>Locale</code> class provides a number of convenient constants
 * that you can use to create <code>Locale</code> objects for commonly used
 * locales. For example, the following creates a <code>Locale</code> object
 * for the United States:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     Locale.US
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <h4>Use of Locale</h4>
 *
 * <p>Once you've created a <code>Locale</code> you can query it for information
 * about itself. Use <code>getCountry</code> to get the country (or region)
 * code and <code>getLanguage</code> to get the language code.
 * You can use <code>getDisplayCountry</code> to get the
 * name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
 * you can use <code>getDisplayLanguage</code> to get the name of
 * the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
 * the <code>getDisplayXXX</code> methods are themselves locale-sensitive
 * and have two versions: one that uses the default locale and one
 * that uses the locale specified as an argument.
 *
 * <p>The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
 * operations. For example, the <code>NumberFormat</code> class formats
 * numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
 * such as <code>NumberFormat</code> have several convenience methods
 * for creating a default object of that type. For example, the
 * <code>NumberFormat</code> class provides these three convenience methods
 * for creating a default <code>NumberFormat</code> object:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     NumberFormat.getInstance()
 *     NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
 *     NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
 * and one without; the latter uses the default locale:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *     NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
 *     NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
 *     NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * A <code>Locale</code> is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
 * (<code>NumberFormat</code>) that you would like to get. The locale is
 * <STRONG>just</STRONG> a mechanism for identifying objects,
 * <STRONG>not</STRONG> a container for the objects themselves.
 *
 * <h4>Compatibility</h4>
 *
 * <p>In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
 * constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
 * Environment version 1.7.  The same is largely true for the
 * <code>toString</code> method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
 * be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
 * of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
 * to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
 * variant field will have additional information in it if script or
 * extensions are present.
 *
 * <p>In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
 * imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
 * between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
 * losing information. Thus <code>toLanguageTag</code> cannot
 * represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
 * do not conform to BCP 47.
 *
 * <p>Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
 * away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the
 * <code>forLanguageTag</code> and <code>Locale.Builder</code> APIs instead.
 * Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
 * then always rely on <code>toLanguageTag</code> for this purpose.
 *
 * <h5><a name="special_cases_constructor"/>Special cases</h5>
 *
 * <p>For compatibility reasons, two
 * non-conforming locales are treated as special cases.  These are
 * <b><tt>ja_JP_JP</tt></b> and <b><tt>th_TH_TH</tt></b>. These are ill-formed
 * in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
 * these are treated specially during construction.  These two cases (and only
 * these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
 * exactly as they did prior to Java 7.
 *
 * <p>Java has used <tt>ja_JP_JP</tt> to represent Japanese as used in
 * Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
 * representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
 * Unicode locale key <tt>ca</tt> (for "calendar") and type
 * <tt>japanese</tt>. When the Locale constructor is called with the
 * arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
 * automatically added.
 *
 * <p>Java has used <tt>th_TH_TH</tt> to represent Thai as used in
 * Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
 * a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key
 * <tt>nu</tt> (for "number") and value <tt>thai</tt>. When the Locale
 * constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
 * extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.
 *
 * <h5>Serialization</h5>
 *
 * <p>During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
 * stream, including extensions.
 *
 * <p>During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
 * in <a href="#special_cases_constructor">Special Cases</a>, only
 * for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.
 *
 * <h5>Legacy language codes</h5>
 *
 * <p>Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
 * their earlier, obsoleted forms: <tt>he</tt> maps to <tt>iw</tt>,
 * <tt>yi</tt> maps to <tt>ji</tt>, and <tt>id</tt> maps to
 * <tt>in</tt>.  This continues to be the case, in order to not break
 * backwards compatibility.
 *
 * <p>The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
 * maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that
 * <code>getLanguage</code> and <code>toString</code> reflect the old
 * code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
 * that <code>toLanguageTag</code> reflects the new one). This
 * preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
 * API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
 * lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
 * can be named using either convention, see {@link ResourceBundle.Control}.
 *
 * <h5>Three-letter language/country(region) codes</h5>
 *
 * <p>The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
 * and the country param be two characters in length, although in
 * practice they have accepted any length.  The specification has now
 * been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
 * country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
 * particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
 * codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.  For
 * compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
 * constraint.
